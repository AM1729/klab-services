# k.LAB Community service

This package contains a reference implementation for the k.LAB community API. At this time, the API provides:

1. A review workflow and API that works with the Resources service to handle the lifecycle of resources after
   submission, and
2. A messaging API to provide simple, subscription-based messaging and email, handling channels, topics and threads.

The API may be expanded in the future to cover more community tasks.
